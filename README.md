# User churn prediction in a gym for customer retention strategy (Sprint 13)


This project focuses on predicting customer churn for the fitness chain Model Fitness using ML algorithms.The dataset includes client demographics, membership details, and activity records.

The goals were to:

1. Predict churn probability for each client.
2. Build user profiles and identify high-risk groups through clustering.
3. Analyze key factors driving churn.
4. Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.

Methods applied include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KMeans clustering. The project delivers insights on how contract length, company partnerships, referral programs, and activity levels influence retention, helping Model Fitness develop a data-driven customer engagement strategy.
